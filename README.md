# java_MariaDB_connection connection🔗


## MAIN OBJECTIVES 🎯

- Plain connection using JDBC
- Pool connection using JDBC
- Connection using JPA

## OUR EXAMPLE

Our project combines the jdbc and jpa methods to execute the different CRUD operations so we can have a quick look of how  both technologies work.


## PREREQUIREMENTS
- Java ☕
- IDE (we suggest IntelliJ) 💻
- MariaDB 🐋
- Maven 🐦


## MAIN DIFFERENCE BETWEEN JDBC AND JPA
1. JDBC allows us to write SQL commands to read data from and update data to a relational database. JPA, unlike JDBC, allows developers to construct database-driven Java programs utilizing object-oriented semantics.

2. With JDBC, we need to write out the full SQL query, while with JPA, we simply use annotations to create one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many associations.

3. JDBC is database-dependent, which means that different scripts must be written for different databases. On the other side, JPA is database-agnostic, meaning that the same code can be used in a variety of databases with few (or no) modifications.


## CONCLUSION 

To sum up, The main benefit of JDBC is that it is easy to use, as well as having a very friendly syntax. However JPA is at a higher level, especially in the development of complex applications. JDBC is perfect for small programs and getting started, but JPA is superior and much more useful.
