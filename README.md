## CONCLUSION 

To sum up, emphasize that it is  a small example of an airline database, which we used to practice the different sections of the unit and understand how they work. We also used previows knowledge since we had to use many-to-many and one-to-many relationships. Also we used postgres to get used to it, also it was very helpfull due to it's large documentation and compatibility.
